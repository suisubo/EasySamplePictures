				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Online fashion stores as an extension of brand design: Our top six picks</h2>
<p>To kick off Spring Summer fashion weeks around the world, we’ve selected six online fashion retailers that communicate their design aesthetic not only through the clothing they create, but also through how they present it on their online store.</p>
<p><span id="more-22042"></span></p>
<p>These six fashion eRetailers recently caught our style eye for their carefully chosen user interfaces, intelligent use of color, and an overall style consistent with their brand story and positioning.</p>
<p>Now is the moment to upgrade your online fashion store, so grab some inspiration from this diverse selection of PrestaShop online clothing stores. (And don’t forget to check out our <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/nine-essential-features-online-fashion-accessories-store/">must-have features list here</a>).</p>
<p><strong><a class="twitter-share-button" title="Click to Tweet!" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Check%20out%20how%20these%20online%20fashion%20stores%20use%20site%20design%20to%20make%20their%20brand%20story%20shine&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prestashop.com%2Fblog%2Fen%2Frunway-selection-6-online-fashion-stores&amp;via=PrestaShop" target="_blank" data-size="default">Check out how these online fashion stores use site design to make their brand story shine   <i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></strong></p>
<h2>1) Ba&amp;sh</h2>
<p>Contemporary Fashion &#8211; France<br />
<a href="https://ba-sh.com/fr/en/" target="_blank">Check out their site here</a> ( https://ba-sh.com/fr/en/)</p>
<p>A joint creation by French women Barbara Boccara and Sharon Krief, Ba&amp;sh is all about contemporary fashion with classic lines. With a brick-and-mortar presence in more than seven countries, the online store is a welcome addition for their very international clientele.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> Paris chic: airy and simplistic, yet warm and modern.<br />
Why we like it: The spacious feeling, emphasized by the white background and elegant slim fonts, puts the clothing in the spotlight. Ba&amp;sh is about silhouette, and while the header slider offers oversized artistic portraits to immediately establish warmth and the unique brand aesthetic, the clothing product shots adhere to a minimalist approach to deliver a better user experience in-line with the brand’s understated chic.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Product pages offering six multiple photos from different angles and simple product descriptions that are easy to navigate. Color scheme: pale grey on white.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22046" alt="OurTop_Bash" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/09/OurTop_Bash.jpg" width="2500" height="1312" /></p>
<h2>2) Bimba y Lola</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.bimbaylola.com" target="_blank">Check out their site here</a> (www.bimbaylola.com)</p>
<p>Concept Fashion Spanish</p>
<p>This quirky Spanish womenswear brand focuses on prints and fabrics, while keeping silhouettes minimalist. They also offer shoes and an extensive range of jewelry and accessories, such as scarfs, hats and iphone cases, all echoing the decorative, quirky prints of their clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> “Beautiful kooky”, boho, bright quirky.<br />
Why we like it: The site, like the clothing, is on the very right side of “nearly kitsch”. The fluorescent side bar complements the floating artistic photos. Scrolling down the minimalist homepage, we nearly mistook it for a concept photography site.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Direct category selection from side bar means customers are at checkout in three clicks. Product pages offer full-size images of each angle on scroll so one gets a real feel for the item. Search, shopping basket, social and contact links take up little space on the smaller right sidebar, but remain prominent and easy to decipher. An example to follow.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22047" alt="OurTop_BimbaYLola" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/09/OurTop_BimbaYLola.jpg" width="2500" height="1312" /></p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" title="Click to Tweet!" class="twitter-share-button" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=A%20fashion%20eRetail%20site%20on%20the%20very%20right%20side%20of%20%E2%80%9Cnearly%20kitsch%E2%80%9D%20Check%20out%20our%206%20top%20picks&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prestashop.com%2Fblog%2Fen%2Frunway-selection-6-online-fashion-stores&amp;via=PrestaShop" data-size="default">A fashion eRetail site on the very right side of “nearly kitsch” Check out our 6 top picks&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></strong></p>
<h2>3) Faguo</h2>
<p>French Men’s Footwear<br />
<a href="http://www.faguo-store.com/en/" target="_blank">Check out their site here</a> (http://www.faguo-store.com/en)</p>
<p><em>This French men’s shoe store also offers a limited selection of accessories, clothing and women’s shoes. The idea? For each pair of shoes sold a tree is planted in France.</em></p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> Authentic, down-to-earth, hands-on, no-nonsense.<br />
Why we like it: This simple site is blog-meets-online-store. Product pages are easy to view and display a high resolution pop up of items when opened. The eBoutique seems almost secondary to the brand story of two Paris friends and their successful launch of a sustainable brand that respects the environment.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Direct category selection from side bar means customers are at checkout in three clicks. Product pages offer full size images of each angle on scroll to give a complete idea of the item. We liked the map displaying the location of planted trees in the “Universe” category, and the homepage widget showing how many trees have been planted thanks to the brand.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22048" alt="OurTop_Faguo" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/09/OurTop_Faguo.jpg" width="2500" height="1312" /></p>
<p><strong><a target="_blank" title="Click to Tweet!" class="twitter-share-button" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=This%20eBoutique%20is%20secondary%20to%20the%20brand%20story%20of%20two%20Paris%20friends%20%26%20a%20sustainable%20brand%20that%20respects%20the%20environment&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prestashop.com%2Fblog%2Fen%2Frunway-selection-6-online-fashion-stores&amp;via=PrestaShop" data-size="default">This eBoutique is secondary to the brand story of two Paris friends &#038; a sustainable brand that respects the environment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></strong></p>
<h2>4) Manoush</h2>
<p>High-end women’s fashion France<br />
<a href="http://www.manoush.com/e-boutique" target="_blank">Check out their site here</a> (http://www.manoush.com/e-boutique)</p>
<p>Founded in 2002 and with a brick-and mortar-presence in more than 24 countries, MANOUSH is the French fashion house of designer Frédérique Trou-Roy. Today, inspired by different cultures from around the world, the brand’s original inspiration came out of a trip to Morocco. Subsequent collections have been inspired by provinces in India, the Middle East and Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> High-end, feminine, bohemian and artisanal.<br />
Why we like it: The importance of a site’s background can’t be underestimated, and this site is the proof. While many online fashion stores play it safe with a light background to keep things easy on the eye, this brand has dared to be different. With the delicate print they manage to create a scrapbook-like effect in line with the brand’s travel theme.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Product pages with vertical scroll of large size product views. We like the easy to use language choice buttons on the bottom right.</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22050" alt="OurTop_Manoush" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/09/OurTop_Manoush.jpg" width="2500" height="1312" /></span></p>
<h2>5) Envie de Fraises</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.enviedefraise.fr/inspirations" target="_blank">Check out their site here</a> (http://www.enviedefraise.fr/inspirations)</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, Envie de Fraises is a leading European maternity brand only available online, with a trendy offer that includes essential pieces for modern moms-to-be. The brand is headquartered in Paris and the clothing is manufactured in France.</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> Quality, French-made maternity wear and accessories.<br />
Why we like it: The site offers a huge selection that includes pretty much everything a woman could need during her pregnancy and nursing period. Yet the navigation is easy and instinctive. It’s easy to search for a specific item or browse categories such as inspiration, nursing or family, from the most practical basics to seasonal fashion collections.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Great navigation. In-context product shots keep the site looking lively and fun without being overwhelming.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22051" alt="OurTop_EnvieDeFraise" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/09/OurTop_EnvieDeFraise.jpg" width="2500" height="1312" /></p>
<h2>6) Custo Barcelona</h2>
<p><a href="https://custo.com/ue/en/" target="_blank">Check out their site here</a> (https://custo.com/ue/en/)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Started by brothers Custo and David Dalmau in 1981, Custo Barcelona was born on a motorcycle trip across America. Inspired by the lax attitude of southern California, the pair returned to their native Barcelona and started a business crafting T-shirts for men and women with screen-prints and illustrations. Now the brand extends to everything from suits to swimwear, and it’s still the colors and prints that keep bringing customers back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Aesthetic:</strong> Bold, bright, and psychedelic<br />
Why we like it: Considering 85% of Custo Barcelona’s sales come from international sales (according to this <a href="http://nymag.com/thecut/fashion/designers/custo-barcelona/" target="_blank">NY mag profile</a>), their online presence is more than a detail. The extravagant style of the clothing is balanced by simple menus and a block layout displaying mixture of runway, product and lookbook shots.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Dynamic product category pages jump to a side angle view on scroll over. An innovative product view filters by size and price, as well as view selection, to display more or fewer items horizontally for those who are sick of scroll.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-22052" alt="OurTop_Custo" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/09/OurTop_Custo.jpg" width="2500" height="1312" /></span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since Google launched Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), an open source initiative, the world has quickly adapted to it. Considered to speed up mobile browsing, the project has had the cooperation of many big names in the technology industry.</p>
<p><span id="more-21895"></span></p>
<p>But what is AMP, how does it affect your SEO efforts and what benefits can your website reap from it? Here’s the whole story.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/08/1-amp.jpg" alt="1 amp" width="800" height="400" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-22006" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #078ac0">What is AMP?</span></h2>
<p>Accelerated Mobile Pages or AMP is an Open-source coding standard that is developed to allow web pages on mobile phones to load faster. AMP enables publishers to take heavy and clunky web pages and streamline them.</p>
<p>To effectively run these AMP sites, a thin version of HTML is included rather than the bulky website version. This slim line of code allows sites to load faster in smaller spaces, such as your smartphones.</p>
<p>Features of an AMP website include;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use of CSS and HTML is streamlined, with the size of inline CSS in less than 50kb.</li>
<li>Includes Image Lazy Load, which means images appear only when you scroll down.</li>
<li>Ads and Analytics are accepted on AMP, just like regular web pages.</li>
<li>No Javascript should be used.</li>
<li>AMP sites must be validated with the AMP Validator which comes bundled with the AMP JS Library.</li>
<li>Custom fonts must be specially loaded, and image height and width must be declared.</li>
<li>Forms are not allowed.</li>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.5">Videos can be included by using AMP approved extensions. </span></li>
</ul>
<p>All these restrictions ensure quicker loading times and will eliminate the frustration of waiting for a long time to access content.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #078ac0">What are the benefits of AMP?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Faster Load Times</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">By far, the greatest advantage of Accelerated Mobile Pages is quick loading web pages. </span></p>
<p>Have you ever tried to access content from your smartphone? Then, you would understand the long wait you have to endure due to the slow loading speeds. With most users on a slow-internet pack, the speed offered is simply not enough to access information on-the-go.</p>
<p>However, with AMP, you can access content faster. According to Google, AMP web pages load 15-85% faster than the non-AMP websites. With faster loading sites, you give your users a better experience. If the users have quick access to information, they will most certainly stay on your website longer.</p>
<ul>
<li>SEO Benefits:</li>
</ul>
<p>It is pretty evident that the future is mobile, and Google is an advocate of this idea too. So if your website is mobile-friendly, Google caches these sites quicker thus improving your ranking. Also, the longer a user stays on your page, the better your page ranking gets.</p>
<p>The importance of AMP pages cannot be emphasized more than with Google’s introduction of the AMP page carousel that appears on the first page of mobile search results. The carousel features articles that are related to the query. It includes an image with the article heading. The kind of content marketing you’d receive is huge.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-21898" alt="2 amp" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/06/2-amp.png" width="352" height="651" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #078ac0">Who can use AMP pages?</span></h2>
<p>Although, Accelerated Mobile Pages are great, is it worth the time and effort? Not for everyone.</p>
<p>Accelerated Mobile pages are useful for sites that publish blog content, news articles or any other kind of content. However, if you convert your products or service page into AMP, you’ll lose the chance to impress your visitors with gorgeous websites, due to the slim HTML code required for AMP mobile pages.</p>
<p>So rather than turning your entire website into AMP, focus on converting your blog section or news feed into AMP. With lightning fast loading on your blog section, users will receive the information they need quickly thus improving your ranking.</p>
<p>If you are a content marketer or a publishing website releasing fresh content frequently, then AMP will be a lucrative tool for increasing your search engine ranking.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #078ac0">Get started with AMP</span></h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-21924" alt="amp" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/07/amp.png" width="869" height="489" /></p>
<p>If you have a WordPress site, then there’s a 5-minute process for integrating AMP. Use the following plug-ins.</p>
<ul>
<li>AMP WordPress by Automattic</li>
<li>Yoast SEO</li>
</ul>
<p>If your website is not WordPress-based, then you’ll have to go to the AMP website and learn how to integrate it by hard-coding it.</p>
<p>Once you do integrate your AMP, be patient. Your content will not immediately appear in search results. Google will take at least a few days to crawl these new pages. It can be a relatively slow process, especially when it comes to already existing content.</p>
<p>AMP is a free open source framework offering lucrative opportunities for you to build your site ranking and search engine results. Don’t lose up on this opportunity to give your users a faster mobile experience with Accelerated Mobile Pages.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In part 1 of our 6 smart competitive pricing tactics, we shared 3 ways to price your products competitively: keep your eyes on costs, never undervalue your products, and compete for pricing at the brand or category level. Today we’ll share the next three competitive pricing tactics.</p>
<p><span id="more-21977"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #3d698e;">4 &#8211; Analyze your competitor’s historical pricing trends to detect sales like weekend discounts or nighttime flash sales</span></h2>
<p>(**Here’s 1-3 of this article.)<br />
Shopping occurs mainly in the present tense&#8211;it’s a matter of “now”. However, the same is not true of pricing. Most companies have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_pricing" target="_blank">time-based pricing strategies</a> or <a href="https://blog.prisync.com/implementing-an-effective-discount-strategy/" target="_blank">discounting strategies</a>. Some of them have public campaigns for their weekend sales, and some of them built a loyal shopper base for their late-night discount frenzy.</p>
<p>Gaining insight into such trends and acting competitively on them is as vital as being competitive at the product level.</p>
<p>This is because these trends or campaigns go beyond offering a simple discount; they are about building a loyal customer base.</p>
<p>Therefore, eCommerce companies should also monitor and analyze the historical pricing trends of their competitors while closely tracking actual prices.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21979" alt="image1" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/07/image1.jpg" width="1300" height="867" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #3d698e;">5 &#8211; Focus on your competitors’ out-of-stock products</span></h2>
<p>Prices matter, but only as long as a company can deliver the product.<br />
Online shoppers consider product availability and prices at the same time. If a product isn’t available, the shopper is likely to make the purchase elsewhere. It works similar to how an expensive product works in the minds of an online shopper. It fails to grab the attention of the shopper and forces it to find another option.</p>
<p>This represents an opportunity for eCommerce companies. You can consider the stock availabilities of your competitors as a solid pricing opportunity.</p>
<p>When the competition is out of stock for a tight-margin product it means that shoppers do not have many choices, so their willingness to pay more will be higher. Therefore, the eCommerce company with competitive advantage and stock availability gets the potential advantage in pricing. With the right technology, companies can gain insights on their competitors’ stock availabilities and prices, then implement this strategy, on the spot.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3d698e;">6 &#8211; Negotiate better deals with suppliers with data </span></h2>
<p>Data is a solid weapon when it comes to business negotiations. It’s a very objective way of presenting an argument.</p>
<p>No one can dispute data and suppliers to <a href="https://blog.prisync.com/tips-supplier-relationships-in-ecommerce/" target="_blank">eCommerce companies</a> are no exception.<br />
It’s common to see eCommerce companies complain to their suppliers about the prices they see over at their competitors for certain products that they also carry in their assortments. Just mentioning this to your supplier won’t get you very far. But when this negotiation is handled in a structured format with clear data demonstrating a supplier-affected disadvantage for that eCommerce company, things may flow in a different direction. Providing hard evidence can bring further discounts or deals.</p>
<p>In short, you can act smart and show that you know what’s really going on between your suppliers and competitors, and confidently demand the best deal for yourself.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3d698e;">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p>Competitive pricing intelligence is a multi-dimensional analysis should not be regarded as only monitoring product prices vs. competitors.</p>
<p>Even though such monitoring offers significant sales and a profit boost, that should not be considered enough. Going further by implementing the pricing strategies mentioned above can help eCommerce companies of all sizes further outsmart their competitors in today’s wildly competitive eCommerce market.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><span style="color: #d40029">Delivery</span></h2>
<p><strong>Delivery</strong> is becoming increasingly <strong>important</strong> for online shoppers. These days, many web shops are focusing on delivering orders as fast as possible, but they often do not offer enough options. A <strong>European study</strong> <em>(MetaPack “Flexible delivery options” 2015)</em> with 3,000 online shoppers, aged 18 to 65, indicated that the <strong>logistic experience</strong> is key in the online buying process. No less than 49% of the consumers is willing to pay more for their purchases if they can select various delivery methods.</p>
<p><span id="more-21950"></span></p>
<p>For an increasing number of customers, <strong>choosing the delivery time and location</strong> is an important factor alongside the <strong>delivery speed</strong>. Customers do not always want to receive their order <strong>as soon as possible</strong>, but they do want to choose a <strong>delivery</strong> where <strong>they can receive the parcel themselves</strong>. For instance, online shoppers often choose delivery in a <strong>collection point</strong> so they can decide when to <strong>pick up the parcel</strong>: after work, during lunch break or even in the weekend.</p>
<div id="attachment_21963" style="width: 905px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-21963" alt="Source: MetaPack “Flexible delivery options” 2015" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/07/PourquoiExperienceLogistiqueImportante11.png" width="895" height="389" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: MetaPack “Flexible delivery options” 2015</p></div>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">Offering a parcel in a collection point is a great service towards your customers, but it also slightly goes against the </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">comfort of online shopping</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">. The solution is therefore offering several options. Enable your customers to choose their </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">own delivery time or location</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">. Do they want to receive the parcel </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">during the day</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">, </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">in the evening</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5"> or on a </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">Saturday</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">? Do they prefer </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">home delivery</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">, delivery </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">at work</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5"> or at a </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">collection point</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">? Online shoppers want to </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">choose</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5"> where and when they receive their order. To have a choice in the delivery gives the customers control. Control of their own freedom. Offering your customers </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">choice</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">, </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">speed</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5"> and </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">convenience</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5"> in the delivery will increase the </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">purchase probability</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #d40029">Online flexibility</span></h2>
<div id="attachment_21964" style="width: 552px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-21964 " alt="Source: The most popular new delivery methods via the DHL Parcel Intervention portal – Oct ‘15-Feb ’16" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/07/PourquoiExperienceLogistiqueImportante21.png" width="542" height="409" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: The most popular new delivery methods via the<br />DHL Parcel Intervention portal – Oct ‘15-Feb ’16</p></div>
<p>Our <strong>busy schedules</strong> sometimes prevent us from being at home at the chosen delivery time. This is why you should give your customers more options by enabling them to <strong>intervene in case of a first missed delivery</strong>. If your customer is not at home when the courier visits, he/she can plan a new delivery moment via an online intervention tool on another day or at a different collection point. An <strong>intervention function</strong> not only offers your customers a <strong>flexible service</strong>, it also contributes to a <strong>sustainable process</strong>: guaranteed successful delivery!</p>
<p>When we look at the trends in the <strong>DHL intervention portal</strong>, it strikes us that when the recipient is not home during the first delivery attempt, people tend to opt for delivery at a <strong>different DHL Parcel collection point</strong> than initially planned. In addition, the trends of our intervention tool also indicate that all other available delivery options are also significantly important. These options give the customer a sense of <strong>freedom</strong>, <strong>flexibility</strong> and indicate <strong>professionalism</strong> of the sender.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d40029">Return solutions</span></h2>
<div id="attachment_21965" style="width: 585px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-21965 " alt="Source: Consumers who purchased articles online, knowing that they will (partly) return them (according to age) - MetaPack “Flexible delivery options” 2015" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/07/PourquoiExperienceLogistiqueImportante31.png" width="575" height="408" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: Consumers who purchased articles online, knowing that they will (partly) return them (according to age) &#8211; MetaPack “Flexible delivery options” 2015</p></div>
<p>Apart from various delivery methods, the <strong>return solutions</strong> are also of high importance. While returning was originally important for consumers after buying, it now plays a crucial role in the <strong>purchase decision</strong> itself. As well as the delivery methods, the return options also influence the consumer when choosing a specific web shop. In addition, an increasing number of consumers make an online purchase with the <strong>intention of returning part of the purchases</strong>. Just as in fitting rooms, the consumer wants to try on several articles in various sizes and colours in order to make the right decision later on.</p>
<p>By offering your customers simple return solutions, you combine the <strong>convenience of online shopping</strong> with the <strong>freedom</strong> to make the right decision. Big players such as Zalando and bol.com are focusing on <strong>free and user-friendly</strong> returns. You too can offer your customers several return services. At DHL Parcel we can support your web shop in offering the following options: the customer requests a return label via <strong>your customer service</strong>, creates an <strong>online return label</strong> him/herself or uses the return label that is already <strong>in the box</strong>. With this return label, the customer can return the order via one of <strong>our DHL Parcelshops</strong>. With the <strong>biggest network of collection points</strong> in Belgium, DHL Parcel is always close to you and your customer.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #d40029">The key to success</span></h2>
<p><strong>The trend has definitely been set</strong>: those who want to be successful –as the leading web shops such as Bol.com and Amazon- need to <strong>expand their delivery options</strong>. However, is it also possible for a small web shop to offer this type of service? Yes, because the world of logistics is always evolving and will need to continuously offer improvements and <strong>innovative solutions</strong> to optimise the logistics experience of the consumer. Solutions that can provide an upgrade in service for the big players as well as for <strong>small start-up web shops</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="attachment_21966" style="width: 906px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-21966" alt="Source: MetaPack “Flexible delivery options” 2015" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/07/PourquoiExperienceLogistiqueImportante41.png" width="896" height="391" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Source: MetaPack “Flexible delivery options” 2015</p></div>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5">It is safe to say that many consumers find where, when and how their parcel arrives remarkably more important than the price. </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">The delivery time, speed, location </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">and the</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5"> return solutions</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5"> are the major motivators for a customer in choosing a specific web shop. Provide flexibility by choosing a logistics partner who is close to your customers and offers a wide </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5">range of delivery methods and return solutions</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5">. With the right offer of brands or products and an optimal logistics experience, you are at the start of a success story!</span></p>

<p>By using the right competitive intelligence technology, eCommerce companies can go way beyond that and competitively price in a more analytical and profitable way. I’ll show you how you can do just that by focusing on some often-neglected business scenarios that occur in eCommerce.</p>
<p><span id="more-21927"></span></p>
<p>Today, I’m sharing 6 business cases that prove eCommerce companies of all sizes can address and outsmart their competition with competitive pricing tactics. You won’t have to undercut prices and give away profit margins. I’ll teach you how you can act smart and fast by relying on <a href="https://prisync.com" target="_blank">automated competitor price monitoring technologies</a>.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #3d698e">1- Stay competitive while remaining profitable</span></h2>
<p>No eCommerce business company can survive by ignoring <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-standard-operating-costs-for-running-an-e-commerce-website" target="_blank">costs</a> and focusing solely on their competition. For all eCommerce companies, competitor pricing and product costs are conflicting forces that both impact product prices. Profitability should be a goal for eCommerce companies of all sizes, and to achieve that, eCommerce companies should always keep an eye on <a href="http://www.ecorner.com.au/FAQs-Questions-Ideas-Centre/Costs-Issues-Starting-An-eCommerce-Online-Business#.V17PYeZ96Rs" target="_blank">their costs</a>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">This is especially true when</span> you’re adjusting prices competitively against competitors.</p>
<p>Instead of undercutting the competition’s prices at every chance &#8211; no matter the cost &#8211; eCommerce companies should analyze their costs to achieve enduring and sustainable competitiveness.</p>
<p>When your prices are uncompetitive compared to the market average, you can fix this not just by lowering the price, but more importantly, trying to figure out ways to cut <strong>costs further up the chain</strong>. Only once you’ve lowered your own costs should you offer further discounts or lower prices for customers.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3d698e">2 &#8211; Never undervalue your products and actively identify price increase opportunities </span></h2>
<p>Even if you can offer your products at a very competitive price compared to your competitors, your prices might be too competitive.</p>
<p>You low prices will draw shopper attention, which will bring in potential customers. But how low do you go then? If the customer’s deal-breaker was finding the best deal online, why not price your product at the max of the minimums? In other words, consider raising your price until it is almost priced at the second cheapest competitor, yet remains well below that.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/top-5-tips-for-price-comparison-sites/" target="_blank">shopping comparison engines</a>, and in the minds of online shoppers, these price increases doesn’t make a difference. However, it will bring increased profit margins that lift up the balance sheet. Best of all, this price increase will not cost your company anything.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-21931" alt="6SmartCompetitivePricingTactics_3" src="https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2016/07/6SmartCompetitivePricingTactics_3.png" width="975" height="684" /></p>
<h2><span style="color: #3d698e">3- Study your competitor’s category and brand level pricing strategies</span></h2>
<p>In most cases, eCommerce prices are driven by category or brand level decisions. This may be due to budgeting operations within a company, or supplier deals in place for specific brands etc. When we consider this fact, solely focusing on competitor product price monitoring and micro-managing product prices feel a little dull.</p>
<p>With the right technologies, eCommerce companies can gain brand and category level pricing insights into their competitors. Aggregation is the method to look to here, i.e. grouping products under a certain brand or category together, and calculating their overall price performance for each site. Calculating an index value for the aggregated level (a category or brand) will give you an idea about how a company is performing pricing-wise for that particular brand and category vs. its competitors.</p>
<p>Such analysis may reveal which competitors have significant pricing advantages in which brands/categories, and which are lacking. ECommerce companies can act upon those comparative results and adjust pricing levels based on overall category and brand management strategies.</p>
